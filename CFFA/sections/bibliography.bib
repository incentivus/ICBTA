pages="389--404",
abstract="There is a protocol called ``atomic cross-chain swap'' that spans across multiple blockchains, but is it really atomic? We analyze the protocol using a modal logic for asynchronous communication. The modal logic allows us to identify some assumptions required for the ``atomic'' property as logical formulas. We first demonstrate that the atomicity fails without some temporal-epistemic assumptions. We further construct a proof that the atomicity holds with strong enough temporal-epistemic assumptions. In both analyses, we use Kripke models of the modal logic. This is the first analysis of multiple blockchains' interaction using a modal logic.",

abstract="Cryptocurrencies enable users to send and receive value in a trust-less manner. Unfortunately trading the associated assets usually happens on centralized exchange which becomes a trusted third party. This defeats the purpose of a trust-less system. Atomic cross-chain swaps solve this problem for exchanges of value without intermediaries. But they require both blockchains to support Hash locked and Time locked transactions. We propose an extension to atomic swap for blockchains that only support multi-signatures (multisig) transactions. This provides greater capabilities for cross-chain communications without adding any extra trust hypothesis.",

We think of ABCD as the alphabet of interoperability for DeFi and as a credit infrastructure which unlike the current protocols is not limited by requiring either smart contracts, over-collateralization, or instantaneous payback.},
