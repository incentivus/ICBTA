\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We proposed components that allow using HTLCs in order to have late-deposition and margin-free swaptions. The later one was claimed to be impossible in \cite{liu2018atomic}. Then we showed that these components in concurrency with other components can build futures arbitrages. Building futures arbitrages and money markets became possible using techniques like overlapping and option delegation introduced in this paper.
Finally, for a larger money market, comprised of many swaptions in relation with each other, we proved two theorems that describe the general rules of these money markets. We also proposed protocols without which money markets can not operate. The multi-leader problem in \cite{herlihy2018atomic} is also solved by the option delegation technique.
