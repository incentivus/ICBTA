Cryptocurrency futures contracts that can be traded and settled by cash are exposed to the centralized exchange single point of failure. On the other hand, derivatives and synthetic tokens under the custody of smart contracts have suffered extensively from security issues and economic vulnerabilities resulting from oracle price manipulations. The middleman, being a centralized exchange or a decentralized application, can be hacked or exploited as long as the user does not own the private keys to the underlying assets of the futures contract.

To the best of our knowledge, the only non-custodial solution proposed at the time of writing is atomic swaptions and their extensions. However, their efficiency is limited by the fact that the specified amount to be delivered by either party should be locked from the negotiation until the expiry date. We introduce a framework to overcome this limitation without compromising decentralization to enable capital-free atomic swaptions and prove several interesting properties of these financial instruments.
