\section{Future Work}

As mentioned earlier, \abcd can be used along with other primitives in order to form more complex contracts. Depending on the application-specific domain, the current structure of \abcd might be either sufficient or not. In a future work, we aim to customize this structure to be fully compatible for integration in more complex systems.

On the other hand, there exist many variations of HTLC which in turn imply different categories of atomic swaps with different properties. The modular structure of our design enables similar variations on ABCD with the associated properties which can be explored in a future work. \newfateme{In particular, a privacy-preserving scriptless version of ABCD using adaptor signatures may be possible under the framework of Schnorr signatures} \new{\cite{10.1007/978-3-030-54455-3_38}.}
